# KeyboardRelogger

A project that uses keyhooks to intercept keyboard events and modify them. The main functionality of the project comes from JKeyHooks and java.awt.Robot

Intercepted keyboard events along with the duration of a keypress are used in a profile that creates a new event with a different function as specified in the profile. 

For an example of what it can be used for see: https://github.com/TMHolen95/KeyboardRelogger/blob/master/src/main/java/profiles/CapsProfile.java
